It's important to note that Steamwebapi operates as an independent service and is not affiliated with Valve, Steam, or any of their partners. All rights are reserved by its respective owners.

- **Steam Inventory API**

This endpoint utilizes a pool of proxies to fetch the Steam inventory data, allowing us to bypass rate-limiting restrictions. The data returned is an exact representation of Steam's response, ensuring accuracy and real-time information. However, if you prefer a more user-friendly format, you can enable the parse parameter. This will provide a parsed version of the data, including item prices and comprehensive details. It's important to note that each request to this API consumes 5 credits.

Detailed Inventory
To enhance your experience, we recommend utilizing the parse parameter with a value of 1. This will provide you with item prices and a wealth of detailed information, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the inventory.

New feature: Tracking
You now have the ability to track inventory by requesting an inventory update on a daily basis. This will enable you to monitor the departure or left date of each item, and the total value of the inventory on that day. The initial tracking time will serve as the entry date's important to note that if another user of Steamwebapi is also tracking the same user, the entry date of an item could be earlier, as it depends on the time of tracking by each individual user.
