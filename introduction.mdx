## What is SteamWebApi?

Steamwebapi is a high-quality API service that provides developers with seamless access to a wide range of information on Steam games, user profiles, inventories, and many more. 

By using Steamwebapi, you can effortlessly retrieve data without having to rely directly on the Steam API, thereby reducing the risk of IP blocking or application limitations. It's important to note that Steamwebapi operates as an independent service and is not affiliated with Valve, Steam, or any of their partners. 

All rights are reserved by its respective owners. Unleash the potential of Steamwebapi to seamlessly integrate game data and enhance your application's features!

## How to use the API?

To use the API, please do the following steps:

- Make a GET request to the designated API endpoint.
- Access the comprehensive API documentation by clicking the "API" button at the top of the page.
- On that page, you'll find detailed information about the available API endpoints and their functionalities.

And that’s it! Start exploring the power of the API today and open doors to the world of possibilities for your projects.

## How to obtain an API Key?

To obtain an API key, please do the following steps:

- You need to create an account on our website by clicking on "Login with Steam". Rest assured, we do not store any of your Steam data.
- Once you have created an account, you can find your API key in your DASHBOARD (top-right) under "API Key".

## Is it free?

Yes, you have 5000 free credits per month. You can use these credits to make requests to our API. Each endpoint has a different cost, which you can find in the table below.

## What if I run out of credits?

If you run out of credits, you can send us a message on Discord, and we will provide you with additional credits or another plan based on your needs.

## Best tools to use and test the API

Discover the best tools for API testing and utilization, such as Postman or Insomnia. Additionally, you can easily access the API directly from your browser by adding the API key to the request URL. For instance, test the inventory endpoint using this format: 

```https://www.steamwebapi.com/steam/api/inventory?key=$YOUR_API_KEY```

## Responses

All responses are in JSON format. If an error occurs, the response will display the error message.
