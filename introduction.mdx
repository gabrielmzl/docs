## What is SteamWebApi?

Steamwebapi is a high-quality API service that provides developers with seamless access to a wide range of information on Steam games, user profiles, inventories, and many more. 

By using Steamwebapi, you can effortlessly retrieve data without having to rely directly on the Steam API, thereby reducing the risk of IP blocking or application limitations. It's important to note that Steamwebapi operates as an independent service and is not affiliated with Valve, Steam, or any of their partners.
