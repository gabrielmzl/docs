## Pre-requisite

- [Locate your API key](https://www.steamwebapi.com/dashboard)

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you need to add the following parameter to the URL:

```bash
https://www.steamwebapi.com/steam/api/inventory?key=$YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Make your first request!

You can do this through a `GET` request to the `/steam/api/inventory` endpoint, like the example below:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://www.steamwebapi.com/steam/api/inventory?key=$YOUR_API_KEY&steam_id=76561199473537425' \
  -H 'accept: */*'
```

You will then have a `JSON` like this in the response:

```json
200 OK

{
  "total_inventory_count": 0,
  "success": 1,
  "rwgrsn": -2
}
```
